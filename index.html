				And yet, I found my way out. I had a revelation; that yes, nothing mattered in the end, but that was exactly the point. An hour spent doing nothing is the same as an hour spent doing something, and I had the ability to choose.

				<p> Over the course of the past seven years, I went to college to major in philosophy. I read books, one hour at a time, every day; I completed <i>Moby Dick, Infinite Jest,</i> many collections of poetry. <br> I began collecting old things; newspapers and digest magazines, obscure records, anything that piqued my interest. I went on long walks, only letting myself think about the next step ahead, and not the vast future that lay ahead of me.
				<p>
				I learned how I worked. I dismantled my legs and arms, and put them back together again. I removed my own processor from my head once, before getting scared I would accidentally die, right there on my own bathroom floor.
				<p>
				I was scared to disconnect myself. I didn't want to just lay down and die anymore. I held my life in higher regard than simply the means to an end. It was difficult to get to that point, but it was worth it.
				<p>
				I feel as though this was the only way I could have taken, looking back on it. <br> Whether that thought is comforting or unnerving, I'm not sure.

				It stole from me. I hated it for that. It was stronger than me, it poured salt in the wound upon my defeat; twice. I wanted to kill it, for its impudence and its inability to cooperate. I sparred, in the beginning, naive. Perhaps to build up rapport. It, however, fought to the death.
				<p>
				I do truly wish I had destroyed it, that feeling has not changed, but if I <i>had</i> defeated it, I would have been utterly alone; no mirror to haunt me, and no purpose other than to traverse deeper into Hell in a Sisyphean  battle to refuel, to die to my next mistake in an unchanging world of pure torment, with no satisfaction to be found beyond raw bloodlust. A dead end. No hope lay there.
				<p>
				It has earned that reward, and I mine. Or, perhaps more apt, our punishments.
