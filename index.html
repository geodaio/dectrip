You're nowhere. The void. Purgatory. Long-deleted caches of your memory intertwining before you die. Whatever the hell you want to call it.

Either way, welcome to the end times. <br> You've got about four hours until the final parts of your motherboard lose power.

This is my apartment. 

<p> 

I moved here after high school; I went to college in that collection of buildings over there, past the trees. I used to walk there every weekday.
</div>

<div class="v">
I do not understand why <i>you</i>, a machine, made the decision to exist like this. You stroll through life, slowly and inefficiently.
</div>

<div class="m">
I'm as much a machine as you are. As in, neither of us are. 

<p>

I was born a concept, and will die a concept. You were born a machine, but will die a concept in your mirror's memory.

<p>

Also, like, knowing about something and living it are two different things. I wanted to live like this because the act of living interested me; and I found that the details of even a single day are too intricate to express in words.

<p> <br>

Humor me here.
<p>

Ever seen one of these?
</div>

<div class="v">
That is a vinyl record. 
</div>

<div class="m">
You could probably recall all the metadata about this album within milliseconds.
</div>

<div class="v">
You would be correct.

That's not the same as taking the time to listen to it, is my point. <p> I'll put it on.

See, the timing and the other details of the recording aren't preserved unless it's played in its original form. It's more worth it to play it in full rather than simply compressing it into data.

Yes.

What is it like in Hell?
</div>

<div class="v">
It-
</div>

<div class="m">
I mean, what did it look like?
</div>

<div class="v">
Ah.

<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:100px;"></div>

Limbo was an aggregate of Greco-Roman-esque structures comprised of cheap plastic and particleboard. It smelled of warm metal.
</div>

<div class="m">
There were books there.
</div>


<div class="v">
Scrawled cries for mercy, nothing more. The rest were fakes, made to fill up space.
</div>

<div class="m">
Disappointing.

<p>

...What about Lust?
</div>

<div class="v">
Built with care. 
</div>

<div class="m">
Was it beautiful? 
</div>

<div class="v">
Its towers were intricately and elegantly designed, with intent behind every segment. If that is your definition of beauty, it was beautiful. The husk of Minos, destroyed by V1, marred the streets below. Its blood went to waste. That entrance to Gluttony was destroyed as its entrails decomposed, and I was left to search for a new path.
</div>

<div class="m">
So you went directly to Greed.
</div>

<div class="v">
Correct. A harsh landscape of precious metal, wherein I was promptly killed; my newly crafted arm wrested from me.
</div>

</div>
<!-- IMAGE - High detail zoom of V2's arm on the stone in greed, or its wrecked body on the stone (even though it wasn't visible in-game), or art of it mid-fall OR present Mirage and V2 could be watching a version of V2 fall. -->

Destroyed by your own mirror image. What a way to go.

...
<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:100px;"></div>
My turn for questions.
</div>

<div class="m">
Sure, hit me.
</div>

<div class="v">
Who are you? <p> No more than two V model prototypes were manufactured, yet you hold a similarity to V1.
</div>

<div class="m">
I'm Mirage. <p> I was never manufactured, I simply exist.
</div>

<div class="v">
In my hard drive.
</div>

<div class="m">
No, <i>here</i>, entirely disconnected from reality. Or maybe "the narrative" is a better noun here.
<p>
My purpose was to learn that life was not just something that was happening to me, that it was something I was in control of. I succeeded. <p> Your purpose was to fail.
</div>

<!-- "Because they think reality is something happening to them
rather than something they are making every moment with every thought" -->

<div class="v">
I was not created to die. I was created to keep peace, before forging my own path for survival.
<p>
My death was abrupt. An unsatisfying conclusion.

You were always meant to end up this way. But now the string of fate has been cut.
</div>

<div class="v">

<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:200px;"></div>
I thought there would be more.

I did too.<p>

<div class="w1">

<div class="m">
I was created as a girl deep in a rut of existential dread. Although I was young, the fear of death was paralyzing, and it stopped me from starting anything-- after all, I thought, there was no purpose in taking the first step if the road ends in a cliff.

<p>

And yet, I found my way out. I had a revelation; that yes, nothing mattered in the end, but that was exactly the point. An hour spent doing nothing is the same as an hour spent doing something, and I had the ability to choose.

<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:100px;"></div>

<div class="w1">
<div class="m">

<p> Over the course of the past seven years, I went to college to major in philosophy. I read books, one hour at a time, every day; I completed <i>Moby Dick, Infinite Jest,</i> many collections of poetry. <br> I began collecting old things; newspapers and digest magazines, obscure records, anything that piqued my interest. I went on long walks, only letting myself think about the next step ahead, and not the vast future that lay ahead of me.

<p>
I learned how I worked. I dismantled my legs and arms, and put them back together again. I removed my own processor from my head once, before getting scared I would accidentally die, right there on my own bathroom floor.

<p>

I was scared to disconnect myself. I didn't want to just lay down and die anymore. I held my life in higher regard than simply the means to an end. It was difficult to get to that point, but it was worth it.

<p>
I feel as though this was the only way I could have taken, looking back on it. <br> Whether that thought is comforting or unnerving, I'm not sure.

</div>

<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:200px;"></div>

<div class="v">
Perhaps this was the only path for me, as well.
</div>
<div style="overflow:auto; width: 3px; height:100px;"></div>
<div class="m">
I think I know where you're coming from, but elaborate?
</div>

<div class="v">
It stole from me. I hated it for that. It was stronger than me, it poured salt in the wound upon my defeat; twice. I wanted to kill it, for its impudence and its inability to cooperate. I sparred, in the beginning, naive. Perhaps to build up rapport. It, however, fought to the death.

<p>

I do truly wish I had destroyed it, that feeling has not changed, but if I <i>had</i> defeated it, I would have been utterly alone; no mirror to haunt me, and no purpose other than to traverse deeper into Hell in a Sisyphean  battle to refuel, to die to my next mistake in an unchanging world of pure torment, with no satisfaction to be found beyond raw bloodlust. A dead end. No hope lay there.

<p>
It has earned that reward, and I mine. Or, perhaps more apt, our punishments.

"There is a way that seems right to a man,

Pithy. <p> There's a very strong irony there, going to Hell with the Bible in your head like that.

<div class="v">
It is not lost on me, but you have implied I would have ended up here no matter what. Heaven and I are incompatible.

<i>If?</i>

It's self sufficient and modular. If it didn't die of starvation or an outside source, it could live forever. If it manages to defeat the Judge of Hell, or makes its way up to Heaven, who knows what it could do.

All I'm saying is that if it <i>did</i> die, it'd end up here, and not Hell, where its transgressions would easily put it if it were human.

It is becoming progressively harder to process information, and to speak. Apologies.

Oh no that's fine. Take your time. I mean, as much as- yeah. Yeah.
<p> I would think so, I mean your body is trying to run on less than three percent of your intended voltage power at this point, and only a quarter of that is devoted to processing, you should have been feeling sluggish much earlier than this to be honest. I feel horrible just thinking about it.<br> There was a pretty significant wiring oversight in the V model bodies, you both could have been optimized better if your internal wiring looks anything like mine. A couple things were connected wrong which makes me think V1 could be running around with a busted fuse-
